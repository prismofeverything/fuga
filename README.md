# fuga

This is a library to read notes from a midi file, analyze them and use the result of that analysis to generate new sequences of notes!

Also included are the midi files for books I and II from Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier.

## Usage

To require fuga:

```clj
(require '[fuga.core :as fuga])
```

To hear notes:

```clj
(def notes (fuga/full-circle))
```

To process notes:

```clj

```
